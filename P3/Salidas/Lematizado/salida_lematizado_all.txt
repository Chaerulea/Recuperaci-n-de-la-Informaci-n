40|finger or fist the choice of decimal or binary representation the binary number system offer many advantage over decimal representation for high performance general purpose computer the greater simplicity of binary arithmetic unit and the greater compactness of binary number both contribute directly to arithmetic speed obvious and perhaps more important is the way binary addressing and instruction format can increase the overall performance binary address are also essential to certain powerful operation which are not practical with decimal instruction format on the other hand decimal number are essential for communicating between man and the computer in application requiring the processing of large volume of inherently decimal input and output data the time for decimal binary conversion needed by purely binary computer may be significant slower decimal adder may take time than fast binary adder doing an addition and two conversion careful review of the significance of decimal and binary addressing and both binary and decimal data arithmetic supplemented by efficient conversion instruction |

321|algol confidential the algol report when first encountered seems to describe very complex language which will be difficult to learn the metalinguistic formula admirably serve the purpose of precisely specifying language but they are certainly not very readable for beginner however experience shown that once the report is explained it is in fact easy to learn algol and to write algorithm in it the language is so general and powerful it can handle an enormous class of problem it is not hard to learn those part of algol present in other compiler language how to write assignment and go to and for statement etc indeed lot of the unnecessary restriction imposed by other compiling language have finally been lifted but algol also allows many unobvious thing to be written we will see later and herein lie problem algol seems to have become too general so many restriction have been lifted that lot of technical detail crop up which are hard to learn and to use correctly in this paper some of the more obscure feature of the language are considered and their usefulness is discussed remark are based on the author interpretation of the algol report |
